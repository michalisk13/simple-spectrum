# simple-spectrum
The tool uses the Analog Devices IIO stack (pyadi-iio) for SDR control and streaming, and pyqtgraph for fast, interactive plotting. The signal processing chain implements windowed FFT analysis with properly normalized power spectral density (PSD) estimation, providing stable and meaningful spectral measurements relative to ADC full scale.
